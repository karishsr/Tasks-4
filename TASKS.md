# DevOps Project Task Documentation

## Completed Tasks:
- Initialized Git repository and pushed to GitHub
- Created and pushed `dev`, `feature`, and `main` branches
- Used pull requests to merge feature branches into `dev`
- Added a proper `README.md` file
- Set up `.gitignore` and created Git tags (`v1.0`)

## Future Steps:
- Add more features to the `dev` branch
- Perform more releases and tag versions (e.g., v1.1)
- Merge `dev` into `main` once all features are stable
- Continue using pull requests for new feature development

## Notes:
- Consider adding unit tests in future sprints
- Review `.gitignore` for any missing files to ignore
